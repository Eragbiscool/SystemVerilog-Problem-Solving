In this problem, we have created a system that creates a randomized array with a size passed from the testbench, the array will also have elements within a certain range that range will also be passed from the testbench as arguments. 

We will then sort the array and display both the array as an output.

**The Output Should look something like this**:
```md
# Randomized array we are going to input: '{212, 194, 538, 308, 476, 864}
# Sorted Array we are going to compare the output with: '{194, 212, 308, 476, 538, 864}
```

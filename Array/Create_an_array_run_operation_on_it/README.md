# Problem

Here we have created a randomized array generator that will do 2 different operation of the array and sort the operated array. The two opeartion is:

* Squaring each element of the Randomized array
* Multiplying a user defined integer to each element of the array

The testbench can choose either or both of these operation.

### $\color{cyan}{\textbf{The Output Should look something like this for SQUARE opeartion:}}$
```
# The initial array is: '{212, 194, 538, 308, 476, 864}
# Array after squaring each element: '{44944, 37636, 289444, 94864, 226576, 746496}
# Operated array after sorting: '{37636, 44944, 94864, 226576, 289444, 746496}
```
